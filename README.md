# Machine Learning
**Intelligent Earth CDT - Michaelmas Term 2025, Week 4**

This repository contains material related to the practical sessions and assessment of the Machine Learning module within the [UKRI AI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for the Environment (Intelligent Earth)]([https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/](https://intelligent-earth.ox.ac.uk/home)) taught course at the University of Oxford.

For more information please visit the [course web page](https://gbaydin.github.io/teaching/ml-iearth-mt2025.html).

## Practical sessions

These are hands-on tutorial sessions that are grouped into four parts reflecting the structure of the module covering eight lectures over four days. See under each practical directory for more information.

- Day 1: Linear regression
- Day 2: Classification
- Day 3: Building a neural network
- Day 4: Building a neural network with PyTorch

There are also two extra (optional) practicals called "Extra 1" and "Extra 2" for people who are interested in gaining more experience by solving these on their own.

#### Setup
In order to follow the practicals you need to have the following installed.

- A Python runtime. [Anaconda with Python 3.8](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is highly recommended.
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) -- These are standard modules included in Anaconda by default.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/) -- These can be installed by following instructions in their websites.

Alternatively you can use a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook, within which PyTorch and the other dependencies are available by default and you can install any dependencies needed by running `!pip install package-name` in a regular code cell. Colab notebooks run the code in the cloud and do not require any installation in your local machine.

#### Demonstrators
The demonstrators for the practicals are [Sixtine Dromigny](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/people/sixtine-dromigny), [Ufuk Cakir](https://cakir-ufuk.de/), [Charlotte Wargniez](https://intelligent-earth.ox.ac.uk/people/charlotte-wargniez), and [Halil Kelebek](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/halil-kelebek).

## Optional assessed assignment

There is an optional take-home assignment that that the students can complete to gain more experience. See the assessed assignment directory for the instructions. This is not a part of the course evaluation.
